# R Workshop

Welcome to my R for Data Science Workshop GitHub repository!

This repository contains all the materials you will need to follow along with the workshop. Inside, you will find a [R Workshop](https://github.com/michaelritacco/R-Workshop/blob/main/R%20Workshop.ipynb) Jupyter notebook that contains the code and explanations for each section of the workshop. As the workshop was designed to be interactive, certain lines of code were excluded from the original notebook that was released. However, the missing lines of code can be found in the Jupyter notebook titled [R Workshop (Answer Key)](https://github.com/michaelritacco/R-Workshop/blob/main/R%20Workshop%20(Answer%20Key).ipynb). These notebooks are both organized by topic, so you can easily navigate to the section you want to work on.

Additionally, the repository contains a ["housing_prices.csv"](https://github.com/michaelritacco/R-Workshop/blob/main/housing_prices.csv) which is the dataset used in the workshop.

I encourage you to clone or download this repository to your local machine, so you can go through the workshop yourself. To run the Jupyter notebooks, you will need to have both Python and R installed on your machine, as well as the necessary libraries, such as notebook and ggplot. Although Anaconda is not required to complete this workshop, I would highly recommend installing it, as it simplifies the setup process. Lastly, it should be mentioned that Google Colab is a good "light-weight" alternative for working through this notebook. For more information about setting up the R environment on Google Colab, please visit this [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-r-with-google-colaboratory/).

Throughout the workshop, you will be working on hands-on exercises, so feel free to modify the code and experiment with different approaches. If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to open an issue in the repository.

I hope you find this repository helpful and enjoy the workshop!
